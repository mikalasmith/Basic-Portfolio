    <h1>About Me</h1>

    <section id="main-content">
      <p> Mikala Smith is a budding full stack web developer, currently attending UNCC's coding bootcamp program. She originally hails from Charlotte, NC and considers Chapel Hill, NC her second home-- where she attended UNC-Chapel Hill and graduated with a Bachelor of Arts in Global Studies.   </p>

    <section id="sidebar">
      <p>She now works as an English Teaching Assistant at an elementary school where she spends her days helping to craft the young minds of future generations, or as her students would put it, "The lady who just <em>won't </em>let up on grammar. Sheesh."</p>
    </section>

    <p>Just last year, she lived in the quaint, and beautiful town of Albacete, Spain, where she also worked as an English Teaching Assistant, and did not let up on grammar with her students there either. In her free time, she travels whenever she can, and when she cannot, she likes to get lost in a good book, a good netflix series, or go on what she calls a "leisurely run", but what others may refer to as "walking." As technology becomes increasingly more prevelant in the classroom, she hopes to bridge her passion for teaching English with her new passion for coding to make a difference in the education system. </p>
